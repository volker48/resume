I don't really know how to summarize 30 years of life and over a decade of 
work experience with a few meager sentences, but here we go. 
I'm a passionate and pragmatic programmer who believes done is better than 
perfect while at the same time believing that software shouldn't be rushed. 
I enjoy writing correct code while maintaining a sense of urgency and momentum. 
I use testing to provide myself with a tight feedback loop and freedom to 
refactor without fear.

            was presented to the president of the university.
        \item Technical lead on a US Army funded Android development project. 
            Assessing the feasibility of and implementing agent based networking
            applications. Also created scenarios for testing and evaluation of
            networking protocols and performed the evaluations.

    Extensive use of Swing and {NASA}'s {World Wind}.
\item Designed and implemented an {HTTP} proxy in {C\#} for a biometrics 
    fingerprint scanner and webserver. The proxy was for both the client
    application of the fingerprint scanner and the webserver for matching and
    enrolling biometrics data. The proxy enables the client and server to
    use an in house pure C content based networking middleware.

  {Technical specialties:}
  {I have a passion for programming and often program just for fun. I've written the
  most code in Python, Java, PHP, and JavaScript. While Python is currently my 
  favorite I try to remain language agnostic and thoroughly enjoy learning new
  languages and I've dabbled in {Go} and {Ruby}. I've also worked with both C and C++ including embedded programming
  in C on the 8051 microcontroller. Experience with web 
  technologies {HTML}, {CSS}, and {LESS}. Extensive experience with
  {XML} and {JAXB}. Written the most {SQL} for both {MySQL} and {PostgreSQL} and
  deployed both databases to {AWS} and {DigitalOcean}. Linux system
  administration (mostly Ubuntu) on {AWS} and my own personal machine. 
  I use {Git} and Mercurial daily. I currently use IntelliJ as my IDE, but have used Visual 
  Studio for {C\#} and {C++} development. I have also used {Netbeans} and 
  {Eclipse} for Java development. My editor of choice is Vim despite 
  attempts to coerce me into using Emacs.}
