I don't really know how to summarize 30 years of life and over a decade of 
work experience with a few meager sentences. I'm a passionate and pragmatic
programmer who believes done is better than perfect while at the same time
believing that software shouldn't be rushed. I enjoy writing correct code
while maintaining a sense of urgency and momentum. I use testing to provide
myself with a tight feedback loop and freedom to refactor without fear.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Performed background research and drafted a proposal for an 
            internal R\&D online learning project focusing on integrating 
            artificial intelligence into Drexel's online courses. Proposal after
            research was approximately \$700,000 under initial estimates and 
            was presented to the president of the university.
        \item Technical lead on a US Army funded Android development project. 
            Assessing the feasibility of and implementing agent based networking
            applications. Also created scenarios for testing and evaluation of
            networking protocols and performed the evaluations.
        \item Team lead in the design and implementation of a 
    distributed collaborative battle command planning system for the US army. 
    Oversaw and mentored junior developers during the project while working
    closely with the lead system integrator to deliver a premium product. 
    Integrated the final product with systems from French and German allies. 
    Extensive use of Swing and {NASA}'s {World Wind}.
\item Designed and implemented an {HTTP} proxy in {C\#} for a biometrics 
    fingerprint scanner and webserver. The proxy was for both the client
    application of the fingerprint scanner and the webserver for matching and
    enrolling biometrics data. The proxy enables the client and server to
    use an in house pure C content based networking middleware.

  {Technical specialties:}
  {I have a passion for programming and often program just for fun. I've written the
  most code in Java followed by Python. While Python is currently my favorite
  I try to remain language agnostic and thoroughly enjoy learning new
  languages. I've also worked with both C and C++ including embedded programming
  in C on the 8051 microcontroller. Experience with web 
  technologies {HTML}, {CSS}, and {Javascript}. Extensive experience with
  {XML} and {JAXB}. Written the most {SQL} for {PostgreSQL} and setup several 
  {PostgreSQL} installs. Linux system administration experience on my 
  own personal machine and servers for side projects. I use {Git} and 
  Mercurial daily. I currently use IntelliJ as my IDE, but have used Visual 
  Studio for {C\#} and {C++} development. I have also used {Netbeans} and 
  {Eclipse} for Java development. My editor of choice is Vim despite 
  attempts to coerce me into using Emacs.}
