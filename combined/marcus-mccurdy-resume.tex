%\noindent \emph{Creative geek with roots in the open source movement, an 
%entrepreneurial mindset and a passion for user/customer centered software 
%development with maintainable outcomes.}
%\\
%\\
%At the age of seven (1989) I wrote my first lines of code in a 
%\acr{LOGO}-like language on an \acr{MSX} (pre-\acr{PC}).  Two years later I 
%attended a conference on an emerging new technology, the Internet, at the 
%Erasmus University from which I would graduate 16 years later.
%
%After being introduced to the open source movement in 1997, I taught myself a 
%variety of skills with help from the open source community.  Since 2002 I am 
%a contributor to the \acr{KDE} project, as my pet project \KTurtle got 
%admitted into their \emph{edu} module.
%
%\KTurtle is a zero-entry-barrier programming environment that is shipped 
%with every Linux distribution.  It is well suited for teaching (children) the 
%basics of programming, math and geometry.  Through this project I hope to 
%give others the same opportunity I was given:\ to learn programming at early 
%age.
%
%From 2003 to 2007 I studied at the Erasmus University Rotterdam and 
%graduated in \emph{Business and Computer Science} (one curriculum).  After 
%graduation I traveled Europe and Asia during a two year sabbatical, on which 
%I worked on several occasions (see experience below).  Most challenging was 
%my work for Intellecap:\ I architected and implemented an open source 
%administrative backend for the booming micro credit lending industry.
%
%Upon return from my travels (\apo09) I joined Zarafa, one of the largest 
%open source software vendors in the Netherlands.  In 2011 was asked to join 
%Intellecap as the \acr{CTO} of their software division (\acr{ISTPL}) that 
%within half a year had to let me go due to restructuring.  Currently I am 
%looking for a challenging position further train my geek muscle.
